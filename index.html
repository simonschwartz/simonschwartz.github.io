  <h1>Work</h1>

  <p>I am a front-end developer with a focus on accessibility, prototyping and open source development.</p>

  <p>I have worked as part of multidisciplinary agile teams to deliver products using:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>Static site generators (including Jekyll)</li>
    <li>Drupal (including GovCMS)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I have an expert understanding of HTML and SCSS. I can hit the ground running with any CSS framework. I am currently building up my skill in JS frameworks, particularly React.</p>
