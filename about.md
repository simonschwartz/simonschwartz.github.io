<p class="abstract">I'm a front end developer with a varied skill set. I don't know everything, but I want to.</p>

## Design

I spent the early parts of my career as a User Interface designer. I spent most of my time helping developers create digital tools, forms and calculators. It was my job to make sure that our products would be as simple as possible for our users.

## Development

It didn't take me long to start building stuff myself. I've spent the last two and a half years as a front end developer. I have a particular interest in [prototyping](/2016/12/04/sketching-in-code/), accessibility and open source development.  

## Other areas of interest

I have a keen interest in DevOps. I love improving the way teams deliver products by using automation, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Integration.

In recent times I have started skilling up in content design. I have recognised the importance of being able to write clear and concise documentation. This has been particularly important as I [contribute more to the open source community](https://github.com/simonschwartz).

## Outside of work

Outside of work I live an active life. I enjoy playing tennis, powerlifting, cycling and surfing. I also don't just build digital products - I am a hobby wood worker and build furniture when I get the time.

## Giving back

I believe it's important to contribute back.

In 2013 I spent 2 months teaching English at a school in rural Nepal as a volunteer.

In 2015 I joined 11 others on a [charity bike ride across India](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/indian-cycle-challenge-scores-for-the-untouchables-20150121-12vlan.html) where we collectively raised over $75,000 for the [Life association charity](http://www.lifeassociation.org.uk/).
